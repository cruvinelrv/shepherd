# CHANGELOG [0.0.5]

## 0.0.5 - 2025-07-18
- Refactored command structure:
  - All CLI commands are now centralized in `lib/src/presentation/commands/commands.dart` for easier import and maintenance.
  - Removed the `cli_helpers.dart` file, making the structure cleaner.
  - Updated command imports in `bin/shepherd.dart` to use only `commands.dart`.
- Export file updates:
  - The `lib/shepherd.dart` file now exports only `commands.dart` to centralize command access, while keeping entity and service exports.
- README updates:
  - Package usage example updated in English, Portuguese, and Spanish READMEs to reflect the new command export centralization.
  - Imports in examples are now simplified and aligned with the new structure.
- Improved code organization and modularization, following Clean Architecture and best practices for pub.dev publication.

- Initial release: CLI and package for DDD project management in Dart/Flutter
- Uses a local SQLite database (via sqflite_ffi) for persistent storage of domains, owners, and related data. No external server required.
- Domain health analysis, owner management, YAML export, and cleaning automation
- Interactive CLI and programmatic API
- Owner type field is now standardized across all flows (domain config and add-owner) using a single allowed list: administrator, developer, lead_domain. Prevents inconsistent or duplicate owner types.
