## 0.0.1 - 2025-07-18

- Initial release: CLI and package for DDD project management in Dart/Flutter
- Uses a local SQLite database (via sqflite_ffi) for persistent storage of domains, owners, and related data. No external server required.
- Domain health analysis, owner management, YAML export, and cleaning automation
- Interactive CLI and programmatic API
- Owner type field is now standardized across all flows (domain config and add-owner) using a single allowed list: administrator, developer, lead_domain. Prevents inconsistent or duplicate owner types.
